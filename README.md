#Loan-Default-Prediction-using-Artificial-Neural-Networks

Loan default prediction is a common problem in the financial industry, as it can help lenders or banks identify borrowers who are likely to default on their loans. This information can be further used to adjust loan terms/conditions, reserve additional funds to cover potential losses, or even deny/refuse loans to high-risk borrowers. In this article, we will develop a machine learning-based solution to predict loan default.

Aim - The goal of this project is to build a Deep Learning model that can predict if a person will default on the loan based on the loan and personal information provided. The model is intended to be used as a reference tool for the client and the financial institutions to help make decisions on issuing loans, so that the risk can be lowered, and the profit can be maximized.
